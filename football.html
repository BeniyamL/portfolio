									<h3>myFootball</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/football.webp" alt="football" /></span>Football is the world’s most popular sport, played by two teams of 11 players on a rectangular field with a goal at each end.
										It lasts 90 minutes (2 halves of 45 minutes) with added time if needed. Matches happen in different formats: such as League Matches (e.g. Premier League, La Liga), Cup Matches (e.g. FA Cup, Champions League), International Matches (e.g. World Cup, friendlies). 
										Football highlights are short clips (usually 3–10 minutes) showing the most exciting or important moments from a match. They include: Goals, Key saves, Skill moves, Fouls/cards, Close chances.
										Football analysis dives deeper into the match to understand why certain things happened. Can be tactical (formation, strategies), technical (player skills), or statistical.
