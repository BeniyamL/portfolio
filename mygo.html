									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									
									<h3>Bus Management</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/bus-col.jpg" alt="" /></span>Buses are used as the most widely accepted means of transporation. They provide convenient, cheap mode of transporation and hence is popular.
                                    but lack of regularization, management, increased the burden on public transporation. Having an integrated electronic management system, smothes the bus management process. As a result, this system was developled as one of the solution
                                    to transfer the current manual practices into a more systematic computerized system. MYgo allows you to take any services from transporation online whereever you are.You will only come to Bus station physically when you are ready to start a journey.
                                    </p>
